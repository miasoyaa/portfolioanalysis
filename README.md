# Portfolio Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains a portfolio analysis project that leverages Power BI and utilizes data from Ndex Systems to create a comprehensive investment analytics solution. The project focuses on comparing portfolio performance against a benchmark, providing insights into return and risk metrics.

## Project Features

- **Data Source:** The project utilizes sample data package from Ndex Systems.
- **Visualization:** Powered by Power BI with intuitive dashboards to analyze and compare portfolio and benchmark performance.
- **Performance Metrics:**

   - ***Returns:***
     - ****Total Returns:**** The total gains or losses over a specified period.
     - ****Annualized Returns:**** The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the portfolio and benchmark.
     - ****Cumulative Returns:**** The aggregate returns over the entire analysis period.

   - ***Risk Metrics:***
     - ****Standard Deviation:**** Measures the volatility or risk. It quantifies the dispersion of returns, providing insights into the portfolio's stability over time.
     - ****Skewness:**** Measures the asymmetry of the distribution of returns. A positive skewness indicates a longer right tail, while negative skewness indicates a longer left tail.
     - ****Sharpe Ratio:**** Measures the excess return per unit of risk (standard deviation).
     - ****Kurtosis:**** Describes the likelihood to obtain regular or extreme returns.

   - ***Comparative Analysis:*** 
     - Comparative analysis between the portfolio metrics and those of the benchmark.
